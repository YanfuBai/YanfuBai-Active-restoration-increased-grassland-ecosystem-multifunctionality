R Scripts
This code is designed to analyze the recovery of plant, fungal, and bacterial diversity and ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) across restoration stages using raw data calculations, diversity metrics, statistical models, and visualizations.

Initial_data_calculation_EMF.R Calculating ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) using the Z-score method from raw data.

Initial_data_calculation_Bacterial_community_diversity.R Calculating bacterial community diversity based on Hill numbers from raw data.

Initial_data_calculation_Fungal_community_diversity.R Calculating fungal community diversity based on Hill numbers from raw data.

Initial_data_calculation_Plant_community_diversity.R Calculating plant community diversity based on Hill numbers from raw data.

Figure2_and_Table_S1.R Calculating recovery indices for plant, fungal, and bacterial diversity and ecosystem functions, and performing linear mixed-effects models to compare recovery across stages. Figure 2. Table S1.

Figure3_PCoA.R Calculating structural differences in plant, fungal, and bacterial communities and ecosystem functions across restoration stages, and generating PCoA plots and boxplots of structural dispersion. Figure 3.

Figure4.R Calculating partial correlations between alpha diversity of plants, fungi, and bacteria with ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) and individual functions. Figure 4.

Figure5.R Calculating ΔMFRI to identify which functions hinder multifunctional recovery. Figure 5.
